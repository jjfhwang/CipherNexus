# CipherNexus: Decentralized Cryptographic Asset Data Aggregation

CipherNexus provides a secure and decentralized system for aggregating cryptographic asset data, offering enhanced real-time price oracles leveraging zk-SNARKs for data integrity.

## Detailed Description

CipherNexus addresses the critical need for reliable and verifiable cryptographic asset data within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Existing centralized data feeds are susceptible to manipulation and single points of failure, hindering the widespread adoption of DeFi applications. CipherNexus tackles these challenges by establishing a federated network of GraphQL endpoints, each contributing data from various cryptocurrency exchanges and sources. This decentralized approach eliminates reliance on any single entity, enhancing resilience and reducing the risk of data manipulation.

The system's core innovation lies in the integration of zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) to ensure data integrity. Each data provider generates a cryptographic proof that verifies the authenticity and consistency of their data. These proofs are then aggregated and verified within the CipherNexus network, guaranteeing that the disseminated data has not been tampered with and accurately reflects the underlying market conditions. This cryptographic verification provides a much higher level of assurance compared to traditional price oracles.

By utilizing a federated GraphQL architecture, CipherNexus allows developers to query specific data points in a flexible and efficient manner. This simplifies the integration of price feeds into various DeFi applications, such as lending platforms, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and stablecoin protocols. The system is designed to be scalable and adaptable, accommodating a growing number of data providers and supporting a diverse range of cryptographic assets. CipherNexus empowers developers to build more secure, transparent, and reliable DeFi applications by providing a trustworthy source of cryptographic asset data.

## Key Features

*   **Federated GraphQL Endpoints:** A decentralized network of GraphQL endpoints, each offering data from multiple sources, ensuring data diversity and resilience. Each endpoint can be queried independently, or through a central gateway for simplified access.
*   **zk-SNARKs for Data Integrity:** Cryptographic proofs generated by each data provider verify the authenticity and consistency of their data, preventing manipulation and guaranteeing data integrity. Proof verification is performed within the CipherNexus network. The specific zk-SNARK proving system utilized is a custom implementation based on the Groth16 algorithm, optimized for performance.
*   **Real-Time Price Oracles:** Low-latency data aggregation and dissemination, providing near real-time price updates for a wide range of cryptographic assets. Data updates are pushed to consumers via WebSockets for immediate notification of changes.
*   **Decentralized Data Governance:** A governance mechanism allowing network participants to propose and vote on changes to the system's parameters, such as data provider inclusion and verification thresholds. This ensures community-driven evolution and adaptation to changing market conditions. The governance system utilizes a delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS) model.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The system is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy integration of new data sources, cryptographic algorithms, and governance mechanisms. This ensures the long-term scalability and adaptability of CipherNexus.
*   **Go Implementation:** The entire system is implemented in Go, providing high performance, concurrency, and cross-platform compatibility. This choice allows for efficient resource utilization and ease of deployment across diverse environments.
*   **Detailed Audit Trails:** All data transactions and verification processes are logged and auditable, providing transparency and accountability within the network. These logs are stored in a distributed ledger for immutability.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go:** The primary programming language used for all core components, providing performance and concurrency.
*   **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs, providing flexibility and efficiency in data retrieval.
*   **zk-SNARKs (Groth16):** Zero-knowledge proofs for data integrity verification. Custom implementation using Go's `bn256` library.
*   **gRPC:** A high-performance RPC framework for inter-service communication within the network.
*   **PostgreSQL:** A robust and reliable database for storing network metadata and configuration.
*   **Redis:** An in-memory data store for caching frequently accessed data and managing real-time updates.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/CipherNexus.git
    cd CipherNexus
2.  **Install Go dependencies:**
    go mod download
    go mod tidy
3.  **Install PostgreSQL:**
    Follow the instructions for your operating system to install and configure PostgreSQL. Ensure that the database is running and accessible.
4.  **Install Redis:**
    Follow the instructions for your operating system to install and configure Redis. Ensure that Redis is running and accessible.
5.  **Generate zk-SNARK proving keys (Optional, for data providers):**
    This step is only required if you intend to operate a data provider node.
    go run ./cmd/keygen/main.go
    This will generate the `proving.key` and `verification.key` files. Treat these keys with the utmost care.
6.  **Build the executables:**
    go build -o ciphernexus ./cmd/ciphernexus/main.go
    go build -o dataprovider ./cmd/dataprovider/main.go

## Configuration

CipherNexus utilizes environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@host:port/database"
REDIS_URL="redis://host:port"
GRAPHQL_PORT=8080
GRPC_PORT=9090
PRIVATE_KEY="YourDataProvidersPrivateKey" # Required only for data providers
DATA_PROVIDER_NAME="MyDataProvider" # Required only for data providers

Ensure the PostgreSQL and Redis URLs are correctly configured to point to your respective installations. For data providers, generate a secure private key and store it securely. The `DATA_PROVIDER_NAME` is used to identify your data provider within the network.

## Usage

**Running the CipherNexus Node:**

Before starting, ensure that the database is initialized:

./ciphernexus migrate

To start the CipherNexus node, execute the following command:

./ciphernexus server

This will start the GraphQL and gRPC servers.

**Querying the GraphQL API:**

The GraphQL API is accessible at the configured port (default: 8080). You can use a GraphQL client such as GraphiQL or Apollo Client to query the API.

Example query to retrieve the current price of Bitcoin in USD:

{
  getPrice(symbol: "BTC", currency: "USD") {
    price
    timestamp
  }
}

**Running the Data Provider Node:**

To start the data provider node, execute the following command:

./dataprovider

This will start the data provider, which will periodically fetch data from configured sources, generate zk-SNARK proofs, and submit them to the CipherNexus network. The data provider's configuration is controlled through environment variables.
